## More About Obstacles

### General Instructions 
 When any player directly hit any type of obstacle from either direction,
it loses the current round and another player starts his/her game.

Game consisits of 3 types of Obstacles:

* **Trees -**  Fixed Obstacles
   Trees are placed on sandy tiles and if you wish, you can
   move behind the trees on the grassy paths on sandy tiles.

* **Ships -** Moving Obstacles
   Ships will move in the River partitions. When a player wins a round,
   the speed of ships for the winning player increases in the next round.

* **Cannons -** Static as well as Dynamic Obstacles
   The positions of Cannons are fixed. At regular intervals, they will fire a cannon-ball.
   Every time a player hits a cannon-ball, it loses the current round.
   But Beware, every time a cannon-ball hits the ground , it explodes which could even kill the player
   if it is present in explosion radius.

### Time

For each round, the player gets 60 seconds to complete the current round. If it fails to
complete it in the given amount of time, it loses the current round.

 ### Scoring

Whenever a player cross a river partition, player increases his/her score by 10 points and
when it crosses a sandy partition, player's score is increased by 5 points.
Try to complete a round as fast as you can as you get a time bonus i.e. the time left after
completion of your round adds to player's score.

### Winning Strategy

The player who finishes the round faster, gets more points. For both the players, their respective scores are
increased based on points gained in a specific round.
When you exit the game (close the window), the screen shows you which player wins or else is a tie-game.
